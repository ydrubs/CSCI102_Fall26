Chapter 2: Conditionals and Loops

In this chapter, you will learn how to make decisions in Python using conditional statements, Boolean expressions,
comparison operators, and logical operators. You will also practice using for and while loops to repeat code,
control how many times code runs, validate user input, and combine loops and conditionals to solve problems.

Decide if a block of code will run based on a condition
"""
