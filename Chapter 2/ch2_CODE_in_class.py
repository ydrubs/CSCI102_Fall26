Chapter 2: Conditionals and Loops

In this chapter, you will learn how to make decisions in Python using conditional statements, Boolean expressions,
comparison operators, and logical operators. You will also practice using for and while loops to repeat code,
control how many times code runs, validate user input, and combine loops and conditionals to solve problems.
"""


##Slide 4 - One way selection statement
"""
Decide if a block of code will run based on a condition
"""


#Slide 5 - If/else statement
"""
Gives the ability to run an alternative condition if the first one does not trigger the code block
"""


##Slide 6: Multi-way selection
"""
Checks multiple conditions to decide which block to run
"""



# --- WHAT HAPPENS IF WE CHANGE THE FIRST ELIF TO AN IF?



## --- ANOTHER EXAMPLE
## Combining logic with a conditional

# print("What color is the traffic light?")
# trafficLight = input("(r)ed, (y)ellow, or (g)reen: ")
#
# if (trafficLight == 'r') or (trafficLight == 'red'):
#     print("Stop!")
# elif (trafficLight == 'y') or (trafficLight == 'yellow'):
#     print("Hit the Gas!!!")
# elif (trafficLight == 'g') or (trafficLight == 'green'):
#     print("Go ahead.")
# else:
#     print("Check your vision, but drive like Mario Kart!")

"""
Given the following variables:

        valid_username = "user123" 
        is_active = True

Ask the user for a username, then....

Write a multi-way conditional that does the following:

	1) If the username name matches and is_active is true, print(‘access granted’)
	2) If the username matches but is_active is false, print(‘access denied’)
	3) If the username does not match, print (‘no user found)

##Slide 19 - Using the loop counter in the loop
"""
The loop counter is a variable that lets Python keep track of how many times the loop has run.

Anytime there is a need to use that information in our code block, the loop counter variable can be called.

##Slide 23 - Augmented Assignment
"""
To add to a variable we can do the following for example:
